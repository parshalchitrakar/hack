#HackElite Reimagining methods to reuse waste water. Theme:Open Innovation

Problem Statement: Reusing,reducing and recycling of waste water using cutting edge technology.

Explanation: The idea is about reducing water pollution using Artificial Intelligence by predicting efficient methods to reuse the polluted water especially released from industries. Our idea not only limits to environment issues but also it is economically efficient.

Solution: Industries dump the waste water into rivers and oceans.Instead of letting waste water into water bodies, we predict the percentage of chemicals by using Machine Learning Algorithms because this method is time saving,cost efficient and scalable.We train the model on previous data of wastes generated by a company for nearly a year and later we can use this model to predict the waste generated by the company in future. By using predicted data, we also suggest methods for recycling the water and areas where we can reuse it.In bussiness perspective, company saves lot of money .
